# Requirements Document for Parsec
## 1. Project Overview:

Name: Parsec
Purpose: To enable real-time collaborative coding in Vim/Neovim.
Target Users: Developers and teams who prefer Vim/Neovim for coding.

## 2. Functional Requirements:

Real-Time Collaboration:
Support for multiple users editing a file simultaneously.
Real-time visibility of other users' cursors and selections.
Session Management:
Ability to create, join, and leave collaborative sessions.
Session access control (invite-only, public, etc.).
Synchronization:
Real-time synchronization of file changes among all participants.
Conflict resolution for concurrent edits.
User Interface:
Minimal interference with Vim/Neovim's native UI.
Clear indicators for collaborators' cursors and text selections.
Communication:
Integrated chat functionality for collaborators.
Optional audio/video call integration.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance:
Low latency in synchronization and user interaction.
Scalability:
Capable of handling sessions with a significant number of users.
Security:
Secure transmission of code and user data.
Authentication mechanisms for session access.
Compatibility:
Compatibility with various versions of Vim and Neovim.
Open Source Compliance:
Adherence to open-source license agreements and standards.

## 4. Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with Vim/Neovimâ€™s existing architecture.
Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 5. Risks and Mitigations:

Handling the diverse plugin ecosystem of Vim/Neovim.
Ensuring real-time performance across various network conditions.


# Suggested Software Architecture Layout
## 1. Client-Server Model:

Client: Vim/Neovim plugin handling UI and editor interactions.
Server: Central server managing sessions, user connections, and data synchronization.

## 2. Components:

Collaboration Engine:
Manages real-time editing, cursor positions, and view synchronization.
Session Controller:
Handles session creation, joining, leaving, and user authentication.
Data Synchronization Module:
Ensures consistent and conflict-free file states among users.
Communication Module:
Manages integrated chat and potential audio/video communication.
Security Layer:
Encrypts data transmission and manages secure access to sessions.

## 3. Technologies:

Networking: WebSockets or similar for real-time communication.
Backend: Node.js, Python, or Go for server-side logic.
Frontend: Vimscript/Lua for client plugin development.
Database: For storing session data, user accounts, etc. (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
Security: TLS for encrypted connections, OAuth for authentication.

## 4. Development and Deployment:

Version Control: GitHub for source code management and collaboration.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment (e.g., Travis CI, Jenkins).
Containerization: Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
Documentation: Comprehensive user and developer documentation.

## 5. Testing:

Unit tests for individual components.
Integration tests for complete workflow validation.
Performance testing to ensure scalability and efficiency.
